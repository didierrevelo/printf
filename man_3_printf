.SH NAME
_printf -- formatted output
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf [num_char ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf function formats and prints its num_char, after the first, under control of the format.
The prototype of _prinft works with a constant char pointer format which contains four types of objects: 
strings, which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences which are copied to the standar output, digits and integer, which work with a
loop to get the numbers and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.
\n
The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the arguments. Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or the null string.
.SH OPTIONS
_printf validates each case to get the properly switch case as follow:
\n
s - get the string from the arguments
\n
c - get the character from the arguments
\n
i - get the integer from the arguments
\n
d - get the digits from the arguments
\n
default - get the other arguments of the input
