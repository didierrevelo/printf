SYNOPSIS OF SH

...imprintf [character...]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The print function formats and prints your character, after the first one, under format control.

The _prinft prototype works with a constant character pointer format containing four types of objects:

strings, which are simply copied to the standard output, character escape sequences, which are copied to the standard output, digits and integers, which work with a

to obtain the numbers and format specifications, each of which causes the printing of the following successive argument.

\n

The format string is reused as many times as necessary to satisfy the arguments. Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or the null string.

OPTIONS .SH

The printer validates each case to obtain the correct case as follows:

\n

s - get the chain of arguments

\n

c - obtain the nature of the arguments

\n

i - get the whole of the arguments

\n

d - get the digits of the arguments

\n

default - get the other arguments of the entry

.SH BUGS

There is a mistake when _printf tried to print a special character like '%'.
